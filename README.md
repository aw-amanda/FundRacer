# FundRacer
Basic code for a multi-page/window desktop application that runs on local host. Made for Windows environments but can be adapted.

Can be used to track donation amounts for fundraisers:

    Open application to the initial page (input.html); click "Fund Race Display" to open display page (progress.html)

    Input a donor's name, a donation amount, and a fund name that will display on the progress screen and update the progress bars in real time.

    Progress bars are set to populate input values from donation_history.txt; reset to return to 0.

    FundRace progress page is developed to be displayed on a projector screen but can be adapted to any style or screen type.

    MUST click "Exit" button at the bottom of Donation Input page to close the server and fully exit the application.
